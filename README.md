## **3. How it works:**

   ‚úÖ  Each cryptocurrency wallet has a mnemonic phrase that consists of 12 words, which gives access to your wallet on any device and from any crypto wallet app,        such as Trust Wallet, Exodus, Metamask etc.

   ‚úÖ  Behind those 12 words is a code that forms your Private Key which like the 12 words gives you access to your wallet. So, you're getting these 12 words when        you create a wallet in any crypto wallet app and it's created automatically by a special algorithm.

   ‚úÖ  In fact, we generate these 12 words according to a specific algorithm and check the presence of —Åoins on the wallets we find.

   ‚úÖ  Then we check the balance of the wallets and give the result, which could be dozens of bitcoins that someone forgot on the wallets.

   ‚úÖ  In the end, after the software found the wallets with a balance, we enter the Private Key to the wallet with any application, Trust Wallet or Exodus for           example, and just withdraw all coins found by the software to your wallet.
